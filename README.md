# Business Innovation Project About Gerontechnology
Aspiring to ameliorate the eldercare problem in Hong Kong, our group has devised an elder carebot, namely "Bonnie". Throughout the project, we have explored the market potential and scalability of elder carebots, and have gained deeper comprehension of the working population’s opinion towards eldercare.

## Abstract
A digital divide often refers to uneven distribution in the use of, access to or impact of information and communication technologies between distinct groups. Alongside with the advancement in technology, the digital divide among age groups worsened. In other words, while technology continues to go further, it leaves the elderly behind. Although the elderly nowadays are now adapted to the extensive use of technologies, the complexity of technologies brings frustration and amotivation to the elderly, making some reluctant to use
them. Therefore, we hope to have a more elderly-friendly device to help the elderly to make the first move to embrace technologies, thus improving their lives with the aid of convenience brought by technological advancement. Plus, a large part of the aging population is suffering from loneliness. So our robot Bonnie is set to be elderly’s assistive technology device and companion simultaneously.
